## Purpose

The 'Acebook' application is a light Facebook clone built in Ruby on Rails. The following functionality is implemented:
* Sign In / Sign Out
* View a newsfeed of all posts
* View your own posts
* Create a new post
* Image upload when creating a post
* Comment on a post
* 'Like' a post
* Flag a post
* A blacklist-based 'fake news' filter which flags news articles from potentially disreputable sources

## Technology and Instructions

Acebook was built using Ruby on Rails. It is deployed live on Heroku - http://theacebook.herokuapp.com
